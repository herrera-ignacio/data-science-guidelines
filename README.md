# Data Science Guidelines

Roadmap to become a Data Scientist, Machine Learning & AI Expert. The goal to those guidelines is not to go through a step-by-step guide, rather point you in the right direction so you can do your own research, training, and expermients, to learn everything you need to do your own projects from scratch or to get a job in this field.

## Data Analysis & Manipulation

#### Must know

* Numpy basics and ndarrays
* Vectorization makes our code run faster
* Select specific items, rows, columns, 1D slices, and 2D slices from ndarrays
* Apply simple calculations to entire ndarrays
* Use vectorized methos to perform calculations across either axis of ndarrays

#### Glossary

* [Numpy](./data-analysis/numpy)
    * n-dimensional array
